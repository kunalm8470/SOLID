#### **Single Responsibility Principle**

> A class should have only one reason to change and should take care of a Single Responsibility.

#### **Open Closed Principle**

> A class should be open for extension, but closed for change.

#### **Liskov Substitution Principle**

> A class should be substitutable for its base class.

#### **Interface Segregation Principle**

> Instead of creating fat interfaces, aim for creating multiple smaller interfaces that the client can consume when needed.

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle**

> High level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but should depend on abstraction.
